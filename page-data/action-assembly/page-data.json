Delegates work together to develop “action plans” in order to make real change in their own communities, in their regions, in their countries and even on a global scale. Their action plans offer the ILYMUN community a direction or vision as well as real-life opportunities to make change.<br>\n</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s this year’s theme ?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the Action Assembly will work towards the reduction of inequalities on a local and global scale by working closely with NGOs specializing on this subject. This will broaden the debate and provide delegates with the tools they need to complete their mission.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are we going to do ?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of the three days, there will be guest speakers from various NGOs in order to share their experience and knowledge on reducing inequalities and to guide us in developing our action plans for change. There will also be lobbying and discussion time in which the delegates will <strong>create projects</strong> that could be put in place, and <strong>develop a charter of 19 acts and/or pledges</strong>. The charter will be posted on the ILYMUN website as both a vision and concrete steps we can all take towards reducing inequalities.<br>\nAt the end of the conference, the members of Action Assembly will present their projects that students can implement and they will present the charter of actions and pledges that will show the ILYMUN participants how they CAN work to reduce inequality.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do we prepare for the Action Assembly ?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will be posting research reports regarding various NGOs.</li>\n<li>We also encourage delegates to research these and other UN posts about Development Goal 10, reducing inequalities:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uua.org/sites/live-new.uua.org/files/sdg_10_reduce_inequality.pdf\">UUA Website</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-10-reduced-inequalities\">UNWomen Website</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/browse/\">UN Browse Website</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnerships/actionnetworks\">UN ActionNetwork Website</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally, we encourage delegates to research and identify an NGO THEY would like to work with to tackle this year’s issue. Delegates should be prepared to present this NGO to the Action Assembly and explain what projects students could get involved in with this NGO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why should YOU join the Action Assembly ?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the committee where your own voice is heard. This is the committee that actually works towards real change. It’s a great mix between the formal debating of MUN conferences and informal discussions. It’s the committee where you’ll collaborate with people to develop real plans and concrete actions in order to change things in your own community. If we all make small changes in our communities, we can change the world! So, don’t hesitate anymore and join us in the Action Assembly.</span></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/action-assembly","title":"Action Assembly"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
