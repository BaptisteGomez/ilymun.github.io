It ensures global justice and safeguards nations’ sovereignty by settling<br>\nlegal altercations presented to it by the Member States. It does so by considering previous treaties, international<br>\nconventions and international law.</p>\n<p>The ICJ at ILYMUN will help you view conflicts from a new perspective and will offer<br>\ninsight on international law and the proceedings of judicial cases. The ICJ is perfect for those interested in<br>\ninternational relations, law or simply for those who want to try something new.</p>\n<h4>What is This Year’s Case ?</h4>\n<p>This year’s case centres on the ethnic persecution of the Rohingya people in the Rakhine<br>\nstate by the Myanmar Republic. This has resulted in the mass migration of almost 700,000 individuals into the area of<br>\nCox’s Bazar, in Bangladesh. Consequently, this persecution has caused major problems for Bangladesh, as they have to<br>\nprovide refuge for the Rohingya people.<br>\nThe two teams of advocates will represent the following groups :<br>\n– Applicant party: Bangladesh<br>\n– Respondent party: Myanmar Republic</p>\n<h4><strong>How Does the ICJ at ILYMUN Work ?</strong></h4>\n<p>The ICJ is composed of</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 presidents</li>\n<li>2 teams of advocates; each team consisting of two advocates</li>\n<li>12-15 independent judges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both sides hold opening speeches to present both factual and legal evidence to the judges.<br>\nThe judges are given time to question the advocates.</p>\n<p>Next, each advocate team presents two to three witnesses. (Witnesses are approved by the<br>\nPresidents of the ICJ prior to the conference.) Advocates are given the opportunity to interview witnesses and then judges<br>\ncan also question the witnesses or pose questions to the advocates regarding witnesses.</p>\n<p>Then advocates present closing statements. After this, the judges deliberate upon the information<br>\npresented to them and compose a verdict expressing their judgment in the case.</p>\n<h4><strong>How do Advocates and Judges Prepare for the ICJ ?</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Advocates</strong> need to research the case and create a report (called a memorandum).<br>\nThey also suggest a list of 3-4 witnesses they would like to have at the trial. Finally, they create an evidence packet.</p>\n<p><strong>The Presidents of the ICJ</strong> will work in partnership with the advocates to create<br>\nand polish these documents and then post them on the ILYMUN website for judges to access. To access those documents, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181026101439/http://ilymun.org/committees/\">CLICK HERE</a></p>\n<p><strong>Judges</strong> should read the documents posted by the Presidents of the ICJ to<br>\nbecome familiar with the case, the witnesses and the evidence. It is expected that judges will act without bias, be reflective and innovative.</p>\n<p><strong>Presidents of the ICJ</strong> will also guide the judges in their deliberation to help them evaluate<br>\nlegal documents and assure the quality of the final verdict.</p>\n<h4><strong>How do I Sign Up for the ICJ ?</strong></h4>\n<p>Delegates who want to apply to the ICJ should be confident in their level of English. Advocates in<br>\nparticular should be confident public speakers.</p>\n<p>Due to the challenging nature and limited places for this committee we ask delegates to apply for a<br>\nrole in the ICJ, by <strong>submitting a letter of motivation</strong> which explains their previous MUN experiences and what makes them qualified<br>\nfor the role. Delegates should also state which role they prefer (judge or advocate) and if they are open to taking the alternative<br>\nif they aren’t accepted for their first choice.</p>\n<p>Applications must be accompanied by a <strong>letter of recommendation</strong> from the delegates’ MUN Director. Send letters of<br>\napplication and recommendations by <strong><u>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12</u></strong> or <strong>any questions</strong> about the ICJ to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181026101439/mailto:kmalouda@islyon.org\">kmalouda@islyon.org</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/international-court-of-justice","title":"International Court of Justice"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
